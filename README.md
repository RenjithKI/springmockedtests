# Spring Integration Tests With Mocks

*Reducing a bit of boilerplate in integration tests that contain mocks in Spring Framework using JUnit and Mockito*

This is a demo/sample app to show an idea how to write concise integration tests in Spring Framework that include a mix
of Spring managed beans and beans mocked with Mockito.  Created for demo purposes for [this article](http://knes1.github.io/blog/2014/2014-08-18-concise-integration-tests-that-contain-mocks-in-spring-framework.html).

The most interesting stuff happens in [UserServiceImplIntegrationTest](src/test/java/com/knesek/springmockedtests/service/impl/UserServiceImplIntegrationTest.java).
The classes used for simplified mocking are [MockedBeans](src/test/java/com/knesek/springmockedtests/com/knesek/springmockedtests/util/MockedBeans.java)
and [MockImportRegistrar](src/test/java/com/knesek/springmockedtests/com/knesek/springmockedtests/util/MockImportRegistrar.java).

Aside from that, it shows how to create standalone console application with:

- Spring Framework
- JPA / Hibernate
- Spring Data
- Tested with JUnit and Mockito

I hope you find it useful! If you like this concept of mocking in integration tests, check out this repo that takes it a bit further and adds support for spies and other extras: https://github.com/hobo05/mockitobeans .
